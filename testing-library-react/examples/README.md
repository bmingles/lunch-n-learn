# React Testing Library examples

There are a few examples in here showing different test cases and scenarios for React Testing Library. Run `npm install`, then `npm test` to run all the tests. You can then modify them to change up the results.

**[Note: Tests using jest.mock will not work in codesandbox](https://github.com/codesandbox/codesandbox-client/issues/513)**
